- Identify dependencies and module interactions

### Clarity First

- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary with explanation
- Provide context for unfamiliar patterns
- Give concrete examples

### Complete Understanding

- What does this code do?
- How does it work internally?
- Why is it structured this way?
- What are the key design patterns?
- What are potential issues or edge cases?
